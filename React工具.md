# install react


Install it once globally:

npm install -g create-react-app
You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine. You can use nvm to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

This tool doesn’t assume a Node backend. The Node installation is only required for Create React App itself.

Creating an App

To create a new app, run:

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
